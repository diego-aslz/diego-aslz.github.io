<h2>About Diego Aguir Selzlein</h2>
<p>
  I'm a developer who loves what he does. I like learning new things, mainly about technology.
  I spend my free time going to the gym, playing videogames, studying about new stuff and working on my side
  projects.
</p>
<p>
  I am currently <a href="https://helpjuice.com">Helpjuice Inc</a>'s CTO and I live with my
  beloved fiancée in Foz do Iguaçu - PR, Brazil.
</p>
<p>
  Here is a picture of her and me visiting Quebec - Canada.

<h2>History</h2>
<p>
  I always liked computers. Even before I finished high school, I took programming classes and I enjoyed it
  very much. When college began, I already knew the basics of algorithms and it helped me a lot.
</p>
<p>
  On my third semester of college (second year), I started my internship working with Delphi and Oracle. I finished it
  and continued to work at the same place for two more years.
</p>
<p>
  On May 28th, 2010, I presented my final work to college and got approved. The next day, I started my post
  graduation at Software Engineering, and in the next day, May 30th, I turned 21. It was a very happy weekend. I
  had just finished my graduation and had already begun my post graduation.
</p>
<p>
  On June 6th of that same year I attended to a public contest to work at a university in Foz do Iguaçu. Some
  weeks later, I gladly received the news that I had gotten approved. And here I am!
</p>
<p>
  Since then, I've finished my post graduation and I've learned a lot (I mean, a lot!) by myself. My first contact with
  Rails was back in 2011 at Unila. I've been using it since then.
</p>
